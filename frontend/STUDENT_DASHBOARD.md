### 4. Navigation and UI

**Header Component**:

- Role-based navigation (student vs teacher)
- Quick access to key features
- Responsive design

**UI Components**:
- Progress bars for visual progress tracking
- Cards for organized content display
- Badges for status indicators
- Loading states and error handling

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration

**Student API Functions**:
- `getAll()`: Fetch all students (demo purposes)
- `getById()`: Get specific student
- `getByClerkUserId()`: Get student by Clerk user ID
- `update()`: Update student profile
- `getPurchases()`: Get student's course purchases

**Course API Functions**:
- `getById()`: Get detailed course information
- Course progress calculation (currently simulated)

### State Management

**React Hooks**:
- `useState` for local component state
- `useEffect` for data fetching
- `useParams` for route parameters

**Data Flow**:
- API calls on component mount
- Loading states during data fetching
- Error handling for failed requests
- Success messaging for user actions

### Responsive Design

**Layout**:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Dark mode support

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Real Progress Tracking**:
   - Integration with lesson completion API
   - Actual progress calculation
   - Learning time tracking

2. **Certificate System**:
   - Course completion certificates
   - Certificate download functionality
   - Achievement badges

3. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Learning path recommendations
   - Study time analytics
   - Performance insights

4. **Social Features**:
   - Student discussion forums
   - Peer learning groups
   - Course reviews and ratings

### Technical Improvements

1. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Clerk authentication integration
   - User session management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - WebSocket integration for live progress updates
   - Real-time notifications
   - Live course updates

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Data caching strategies
   - Lazy loading for course content
   - Image optimization

## Usage Instructions

### For Students

1. **Access Dashboard**: Navigate to `/student` to view your learning dashboard
2. **View Courses**: See all enrolled courses with progress indicators
3. **Track Progress**: Click on any course to view detailed progress
4. **Manage Profile**: Access profile settings via the profile tab or `/student/profile`
5. **Continue Learning**: Use the "Continue" buttons to resume course content

### For Developers

1. **API Endpoints**: All student-related API calls are in `/lib/api/students.ts`
2. **Components**: Reusable UI components in `/components/ui/`
3. **Pages**: Student pages are in `/app/student/`
4. **Navigation**: Header component provides consistent navigation
